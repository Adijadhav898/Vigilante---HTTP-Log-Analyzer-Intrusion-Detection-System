# Vigilante---HTTP-Log-Analyzer-Intrusion-Detection-System
Vigilante - Real-time HTTP Log Analyzer &amp; IDS Vigilante is a powerful, open-source intrusion detection system specifically designed for web server log analysis. Built with Python, it provides real-time monitoring and instant alerts for suspicious activities, helping you detect and respond to cyber threats before they cause damage.

üö® Why Vigilante?
In today's threat landscape, web servers are constantly under attack. Traditional security tools often miss subtle attack patterns hidden in log files. Vigilante fills this gap by:
Real-time Analysis: Monitor logs as they're written, like a digital watchdog
Instant Alerts: Get immediate notifications for suspicious activities
Comprehensive Detection: Identify multiple attack vectors simultaneously
Easy Deployment: No complex setup - just point it at your log files

‚ú® Key Features
üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layer Threat Detection
SQL Injection Detection: Identify UNION SELECT, command execution attempts
Path Traversal Attacks: Detect directory climbing and LFI attempts
XSS Attack Patterns: Spot script injection and DOM manipulation
Sensitive File Access: Monitor access to config files, backups, and credentials
Admin Panel Scanning: Catch unauthorized access attempts to admin areas

üìä Intelligent Monitoring
Brute Force Protection: Detect rapid-fire login attempts and DoS attacks
Suspicious User Agent Identification: Flag known hacking tools and scanners
HTTP Error Analysis: Identify scanning patterns from error responses
Custom Rule Support: Extend detection capabilities with custom patterns

üéØ Operational Excellence
Real-time Tail Mode: Continuous monitoring like tail -f with security analysis
Historical Analysis: Process existing log files for forensic investigation
Colored Terminal Output: Easy-to-read, prioritized alert system
Performance Statistics: Monitor processing speed and detection metrics
